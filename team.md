# Introduction of Teammates

## Name : But Wing Han Josephine:
  Hi everyone! My name is Josephine But and this is my fifth class in the MSSD program. I live in California (PST time) with my family ( my husband and my 2 kids). The best time for me to participate in Zoom meetings are between the hours of 11AM and 5PM PST, M-F. I worked as a Programmer/Software Developer/Tester for about 9 years and then I quit my job since I moved to USA from Canada 12 years ago and stay home as a full time Mom.  Now I want to gain new knowledge in order to go back to my previous career in the near future and I know this MSSD program will give me the opportunity to gain my knowledge and to put my skills to the real world through projects. I look forward to work with you all! My GitHub Account is https://github.com/josebGithub/
